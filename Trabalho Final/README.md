<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project consists of creating a program capable of indexing words from one or more text documents.

* NAME
indexer - index words from text documents

* SYNOPSIS
indexer --freq N FILE
indexer --freq-word WORD FILE
indexer --search TERM FILE [FILE ...]

* DESCRIPTION
The indexer program counts the occurrence of words in text documents.
Based on this count, it allows searching for the number of occurrences of a
specific word in a document or selecting relevant documents for a given
search term.
The indexer program transforms all letters to lowercase and ignores
characters such as numbers and punctuations.
When executed with the --freq option, the indexer program will display
the number of occurrences of the N most frequent words in the document
passed as a parameter, in descending order of occurrences.
When executed with the --freq-word option, the indexer program displays
the count of a specific word in the document passed as a parameter.
Finally, when executed with the --search option, the indexer program
presents a list of the most relevant documents for a given search term.
To do so, the program uses the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency) calculation.

* OPTIONS
--freq N FILE
Displays the number of occurrences of the N words that appear the most in
FILE, in descending order of occurrence.
--freq-word WORD FILE
Displays the number of occurrences of WORD in FILE.
--search TERM FILE [FILE ...]
Displays a list of the most relevant FILES found by searching for TERM.
The list is presented in descending order of relevance.
TERM may contain more than
